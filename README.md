# üìö About

![plinder_banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43d129f2-3bb6-4903-81fa-182c351c64b6)

**plinder**, short for **p**rotein **l**igand **in**teractions **d**ataset and **e**valuation **r**esource, is a dataset and resource for training and evaluation of protein-ligand docking algorithms.

It is a comprehensive, annotated, high quality dataset, including:

- \> 400k PLI systems across > 11k SCOP domains and > 50k unique small molecules
- 500+ annotations for each system, including protein and ligand properties, quality, matched molecular series and more
- Automated curation pipeline to keep up with the PDB
- 14 PLI metrics and over 20 billion similarity scores
- Unbound \(_apo_\) and _predicted_ Alphafold2 structures linked to _holo_ systems
- `train-val-test` splits and ability to tune splitting based on the learning task
- Robust evaluation harness to simplify and standard performance comparison between models

The `plinder` project is a community effort, launched by the University of Basel, SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, VantAI, NVIDIA, MIT CSAIL, and will be regularly updated
We highly welcome contributions!
If you find `plinder` useful, please see the citation file for details on how to cite.

To accelerate community adoption, PLINDER will be used as the field‚Äôs new Protein-Ligand interaction dataset standard as part of an exciting competition at the upcoming 2024 [Machine Learning in Structural Biology (MLSB)](https://mlsb.io/) Workshop at NeurIPS, one of the fields‚Äô premiere academic gatherings, which will be announced shortly.

# üë®üíª Getting Started

Please use a virtual environment for the `plinder` project.
We recommend the [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) environment manager.

**NOTE**: We currently only support a Linux environment. `plinder`
uses `openstructure` for some of its functionality and is available
from the `aivant` conda channel using `conda install aivant::openstructure`,
but it is only built targeting Linux architectures. We also depend on
`networkit>=11.0` which as of the time of writing does not build from source
cleanly on MacOS. For MacOS users, please see the relevant
[docker](#package-publishing) resources below.

## Install plinder

The `plinder` package can be obtained from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/plinder-org/plinder.git
    cd plinder
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    mamba activate plinder
    pip install .

Or with a development installation:

    cd plinder
    pip install -e '.[dev]'

# ‚¨áÔ∏è Getting the dataset


A work-in-progress documentation is available [here](https://plinder-org.github.io/plinder/), but in short we provide 2 ways of interacting with `plinder`:

1. A python API: using the `plinder.core` API, you can transparently and lazily
download and interact with most of the components of the dataset.

2. Via raw files on bucket: if you prefer to use the dataset directly, you can fetch it using [`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) from google cloud storage.


If you go with route 2, see below sections.

## Downloading the dataset

    export PLINDER_RELEASE=2024-04 # Current release
    export PLINDER_ITERATION=v1 # Current iteration
    gsutil -m cp -r gs://plinder/${PLINDER_RELEASE}/${PLINDER_ITERATION}/* ~/.local/share/plinder/${PLINDER_RELEASE}/${PLINDER_ITERATION}/

**NOTE!**: the version used for the preprint is `gs://plinder/2024-04/v1`, however, we plan to release a newer version with updated annotations to be used for the MLSB challenge (`gs://plinder/2024-06/v2`) by Aug 18th.

This yields the following structure, with the `systems`, `splits`, and `index/annotation_table.parquet` being most important for direct usage and the rest containing useful annotations and medadata.


```bash
2024-04/                     # The "`plinder` release" (`PLINDER_RELEASE`)
|-- v1                       # The "`plinder` iteration" (`PLINDER_ITERATION`)
|   |-- systems              # Actual structure files for all systems (split by `two_char_code` and zipped)
|   |-- splits               # List of system ids in a .parquet and each split  the configs used to generate them (if available)
|   |-- clusters             # Pre-calculated cluster labels derived from the protein similarity dataset
|   |-- entries              # Raw annotations prior to consolidation (split by `two_char_code` and zipped)
|   |-- fingerprints         # Index mapping files for the ligand similarity dataset
|   |-- index                # Consolidated tabular annotations
|   |-- leakage              # Leakage results
|   |-- ligand_scores        # Ligand similarity parquet dataset
|   |-- ligands              # Ligand data expanded from entries for computing similarity
|   |-- linked_structures    # Linked structures
|   |-- mmp                  # Matched Molecular Series/Pair data
|   |-- scores               # Extended protein similarity parquet dataset
```



## Unpacking the structure files:

Identical to the PDB NextGen Archive, we split the structures into subdirectories of chunks to make loading and querying speed palatable.

The structure files can be found in the subfolder `plinder/${PLINDER_RELEASE}/${PLINDER_ITERATION}/systems`. To unpack the structures do the following

```bash
cd plinder/${PLINDER_RELEASE}/${PLINDER_ITERATION}/systems; for i in ls *zip; do unzip $i; done
```

This will yield directories such as `7zzh__1__1.A_4.A__4.C`, which is what we call a `plinder system id` of the form `<pdbid>__<biounit>__<chain_ids_of_receptor>__<chain_ids_of_ligand>`.
The directory contains `mmcif`, `pdb` and `sdf` file formats as well as some additional metadata (like chain mapping and fastas).

The naming of the directory is by `system` - since a given PDB entry can contain multiple protein-ligand complexes, we assign a plinder system id to every system. These `system id`s are also used for retrieving the splits, as shown in the next step

### Accessing the splits files:

`plinder/${PLINDER_RELEASE}/${PLINDER_ITERATION}/splits` contains an index for splits contained in a single parquet file. The most current split is `gs://plinder/2024-04/v1/splits/plinder-pl50.parquet` containing the pl50 split from the preprint. (Again: note this will be shortly updated to v2 and the v2 split will be used for the MLSB leaderboard)

```python
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> df = pd.read_parquet("gs://plinder/2024-04/v1/splits/plinder-pl50.parquet")
>>> df.head()
               system_id  split  cluster cluster_for_val_split
0      3grt__1__1.A__1.B  train  c100718                    c0
1  3grt__1__1.A_2.A__1.C  train  c196491                    c0
2      3grt__1__2.A__2.B  train  c100727                    c0
3  3grt__1__1.A_2.A__2.C  train  c234445                    c0
4      1grx__1__1.A__1.B  train  c186691                  c154
```

With the `system_id` contained in these split files, you can load the respective train, val & test splits **after unzipping** the `systems` directory. E.g. as shown in the Dataframe above, `~/.local/share/plinder/2024-04/v1/systems/1grx__1__1.A__1.B/system.cif` will contain the full mmcif of the system. We also provide cif files of seperated receptors (`*/receptor.cif`) and ligands (`*/ligand_files/*.sdf`) as well as pdb files (`*/receptor.pdb`) but **strongly encourage cif**, pdb is considered a [legacy file format](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-to-pdbx-mmcif).


Note: a non-redundant and single-ligand smaller subset of this version was used to train diffdock in the paper and is available at 2024-04/v0.

The folder also contains a `.yaml` which is the config used to generate the split and can be ignored unless you want to reproduce the splits.


## üî¢ Plinder versions

We version the `plinder` dataset with two controls:

- `PLINDER_RELEASE`: the month stamp of the last RCSB sync
- `PLINDER_ITERATION`: value that enables iterative development within a release

We version the `plinder` application using an automated semantic
versioning scheme based on the `git` commit history.
The `plinder.data` package is responsible for generating a dataset
release and the `plinder.core` package makes it easy to interact
with the dataset.

Changelog:
- 2024-06/v2 (Upcoming):
    - Improved SDF saving to handle some bond order issues
    - Updated system definition to be more stable and independent of PLIP
    - Added binding affinities from BindingDB and added "has_affinity" as priority for test split
    - Annotated all crystal contacts
    - Improved covalency detection

- 2024-04/v1 (Current): Version with redundancy removal by protein pocket and ligand similarity.
- 2024-04/v0: Version used to re-train DiffDock in the paper, with redundancy removal based on \<pdbid\>\_\<ligand ccd codes\>

## üèÖ Gold standard benchmark sets

As part of `plinder` resource we also provide train, validation and test splits that are curated to minimize the information leakage based on protein-ligand interaction similarity. In addition, we have prioritized the systems that has a linked experimental `apo` structure or matched molecular series to support realistic inference scenarios for hit discovery and optimization.
Finally, a particular care is taken for test set that is further prioritized to contain high quality structures to provide unambiguous ground-truths for performance benchmarking.

![test_stratification](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bb96534-f939-42b5-bf85-5ac3a71aa324)

Moreover, as we enticipate this resource to be used for benchmarking a wide range of methods, including those simultaneously predicting protein structure (aka. co-folding) or those generating novel ligand structures, we further stratified test (by novel ligand, pocket, protein or all) to cover a wide range of tasks.

**This will be made available for the v2 split on August 18th**

## ‚öñÔ∏è Evaluation harness

See the [`plinder.eval`](docs/eval/README.md) docs for more details.

## üì¶ Dataloader

The `plinder.data.loader` package contains a `PyTorch` dataloader for the dataset using the `atom3d` format. It is an example of using the `plinder.core` API
to implement a dataloader, but is not the only way to use the dataset.

**Note**: The dataloader requires both `torch` and `atom3d` to be installed. You use the `[loader]` dependency block when installing `plinder`:

    pip install .[loader]

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Filters & Annotations

See the [`plinder.data`](docs/data/README.md) docs for more details.

## üì° Future work

We are currently working on the following:

- Implementing the Dataloader
- Establishing a leaderboard
- Improving the documentation and examples

# üë®üíª Code organization

This code is split into 4 sub-packages

- `plinder.core`: core data structures for interacting with and loading the dataset.
- `plinder.data`: core code for generating the dataset
- `plinder.eval`: evaluation harness for the dataset that takes as an input predicted and ground truth structures in a pre-determined folder structure and returns a leaderboard-ready set of entries
- `plinder.methods`: implementations of the methods in the leaderboard that leverage plinder-primitives for training & running

# üíΩ Dataset Generation

![workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cde72643-5fdf-4998-8719-216d0cef2706)

See the [End-to-end pipeline](docs/data/README.md) description for technical details about the dataset generation.

# üìù Examples & documentation

Package documentation, including API documentation, [example notebooks](examples/), and supplementary guides, are made available.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Dev guide

To develop and test changes to the source code, please use a development installation:

## Dev mode install

    git clone https://github.com/plinder-org/plinder.git
    # OR
    git clone git@github.com:plinder-org/plinder.git
    cd plinder
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    mamba activate plinder
    pip install -e '.[dev]'

Please install pre-commit hooks (the same checks will run in CI):

    pre-commit install

## Test suite

Test linting checks:

    tox -e lint

Run typing checks:

    tox -e type

Run the test suite:

    tox -e test

We lint with `ruff`. See `tox.ini` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for details.

## Debugging

In order to change log levels in `plinder`, please set:

    export PLINDER_LOG_LEVEL=10

## Contributing

This is a community effort and as such we highly encourage contributions.

## Package publishing

We publish the `plinder` project as a docker container, to ensure the highest
level of compatibility with non-Linux platforms. See the relevant docker resources
here for more details:

- `docker-compose.yml`: defines a `base` image, the `plinder` "app" and a `test` container
- `dockerfiles/base/`: contains the files for the `base` image
- `dockerfiles/main/`: contains the files for the `plinder` "app" image

The CI workflow will automatically semver bump the `plinder` version and publish
the `plinder` image to the GitHub Container Registry on merges to `main`. Control
over the version bumping semantics is handled by inspecting the commit history
since the previous release:

- If `bumpversion skip` is present in the commit message, the version will not be bumped
- If `bumpversion major` is present in the commit message, the major version will be bumped
- If `bumpversion minor` is present in the commit message, the minor version will be bumped
- If `bumpversion patch` is present in the commit message (or nothing is found), the patch version will be bumped

**NOTE**: The CI workflow will use the **most recent** match in the commit history to make its decision.
