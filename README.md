# üìö About

![plinder_banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43d129f2-3bb6-4903-81fa-182c351c64b6)

**plinder**, short for **p**rotein **l**igand **in**teractions **d**ataset and **e**valuation **r**esource, is a dataset and resource for training and evaluation of protein-ligand docking algorithms.


It is a comprehensive, annotated, high quality dataset, including:

- \> 400k PLI systems across > 11k SCOP domains and > 50k unique small molecules
- 500+ annotations for each system, including protein and ligand properties, quality, matched molecular series and more
- Automated curation pipeline to keep up with the PDB
- 14 PLI metrics and over 20 billion similarity scores
- Unbound \(_apo_\) and _predicted_ Alphafold2 structures linked to _holo_ systems
- `train-val-test` splits and ability to tune splitting based on the learning task
- Robust evaluation harness to simplify and standard performance comparison between models

The `plinder` project is a community effort, launched by the University of Basel, SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, VantAI, NVIDIA, MIT CSAIL, and will be regularly updated
We highly welcome contributions!
If you find `plinder` useful, please see the citation file for details on how to cite.

To accelerate community adoption, PLINDER will be used as the field‚Äôs new Protein-Ligand interaction dataset standard as part of an exciting competition at the upcoming 2024 [Machine Learning in Structural Biology (MLSB)](https://mlsb.io/) Workshop at NeurIPS, one of the fields‚Äô premiere academic gatherings, which will be announced shortly.

# üë®üíª Getting Started

Please use a virtual environment for the `plinder` project.
We recommend the [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) environment manager.

**NOTE**: We currently only support a Linux environment. `plinder`
uses `openstructure` for some of its functionality and is available
from the `aivant` conda channel using `conda install aivant::openstructure`, but it is only built targeting Linux architectures.
For MacOS users, please see the relevant [docker](#package-publishing) resources below.

## Install plinder

The `plinder` package can be obtained from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/plinder-org/plinder.git
    cd plinder
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    mamba activate plinder
    pip install .

Or with a development installation:

    cd plinder
    pip install -e '.[dev]'

# ‚¨áÔ∏è Getting the dataset

Using the `plinder.core` API, you can transparently and lazily
download and interact with most of the components of the dataset.
However, if you prefer to use the dataset directly, you can
fetch it using [`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil).
For portions of the code that still assume
an already available pre-existing dataset, you will need to use `gsutil`.

To download the manifest of available versions:

    gsutil -m cp -r gs://plinder/manifest.md .

Then you can choose to download a particular README version or download the entire dataset with:

    export PLINDER_RELEASE=2024-06
    export PLINDER_ITERATION=v2
    gsutil -m cp -r gs://plinder/${PLINDER_RELEASE}/${PLINDER_ITERATION}/* ~/.local/share/plinder/${PLINDER_RELEASE}/${PLINDER_ITERATION}/

View the hierarchy of a particular version of the dataset with:

    gsutil ls gs://plinder/2024-06/v2/

Note that `gsutil` also supports glob patterns like:

    gsutil ls 'gs://plinder/2024-04/v1/fingerprints/*'

This will list the files at the given path in cloud storage.

**NOTE**: We keep the default `PLINDER_RELEASE` and `PLINDER_ITERATION` in the source code up-to-date
with the latest version of the dataset, so if you plan to use a different version, be sure to set
the environment variables accordingly.

## üî¢ Plinder versions

We version the `plinder` dataset with two controls:

- `PLINDER_RELEASE`: the month stamp of the last RCSB sync
- `PLINDER_ITERATION`: value that enables iterative development within a release

We version the `plinder` application using an automated semantic
versioning scheme based on the `git` commit history.
The `plinder.data` package is responsible for generating a dataset
release and the `plinder.core` package makes it easy to interact
with the dataset.

## üèÖ Gold standard benchmark sets

As part of `plinder` resource we also provide train, validation and test splits that are curated to minimize the information leakage based on protein-ligand interaction similarity. In addition, we have prioritized the systems that has a linked experimental `apo` structure or matched molecular series to support realistic inference scenarios for hit discovery and optimization.
Finally, a particular care is taken for test set that is further prioritized to contain high quality structures to provide unambiguous ground-truths for performance benchmarking.

![plinder](./assets/plinder_test_stratification.png)

Moreover, as we enticipate this resource to be used for benchmarking a wide range of methods, including those simultaneously predicting protein structure (aka. co-folding) or those generating novel ligand structures, we further stratified test (by novel ligand, pocket, protein or all) to cover a wide range of tasks.

Our latest test split [#TODO] contains:

| Novel   |   # of systems | # of high quality |  stratification criteria | 
|:--------|---------------:|------------------:|:---------------:|
| pocket  | 5152 | 5149 | PLI shared < 50 _&_  Pocket shared lDDT < 0.5 |
| ligand  | 2375 | 2375 | ECFP4 fingerprint similarity < 0.3 |
| protein |  960 |  960 | Protein Seq. Sim. < 0.3 _&_ Protein lDDT > 0.7 |
| all     |  249 |  249 | all of the above |
| none    |    0 |    0 | none of the above |

- `plinder.data`: core code for generating the dataset
- `plinder.eval`: evaluation harness for the dataset that takes as an input predicted and ground truth structures in a pre-determined folder structure and returns a leaderboard-ready set of entries
- `plinder.methods`: implementations of the methods in the leaderboard that leverage plinder-primitives for training & running

# üíΩ Dataset Generation

![workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cde72643-5fdf-4998-8719-216d0cef2706)

See the [End-to-end pipeline](#src/plinder-data/README.md) description for technical details about the dataset generation.

# üìù Examples & documentation

Package documentation, including API documentation, [example notebooks](examples/), and supplementary guides, are made available.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Dev guide

To develop and test changes to the source code, please use a development installation:

## Dev mode install

    git clone https://github.com/plinder-org/plinder.git
    # OR
    git clone git@github.com:plinder-org/plinder.git
    cd plinder
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    mamba activate plinder
    pip install -e '.[dev]'

Please install pre-commit hooks (the same checks will run in CI):

    pre-commit install

## Test suite

Test linting checks:

    tox -e lint

Run typing checks:

    tox -e type

Run the test suite:

    tox -e test

We lint with `ruff`. See `tox.ini` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for details.

## Debugging

In order to change log levels in `plinder`, please set:

    export PLINDER_LOG_LEVEL=10

## Contributing

This is a community effort and as such we highly encourage contributions.

## Package publishing

We publish the `plinder` project as a docker container, to ensure the highest
level of compatibility with non-Linux platforms. See the relevant docker resources
here for more details:

- `docker-compose.yml`: defines a `base` image, the `plinder` "app" and a `test` container
- `dockerfiles/base/`: contains the files for the `base` image
- `dockerfiles/main/`: contains the files for the `plinder` "app" image

The CI workflow will automatically semver bump the `plinder` version and publish
the `plinder` image to the GitHub Container Registry on merges to `main`. Control
over the version bumping semantics is handled by inspecting the commit history
since the previous release:

- If `bumpversion skip` is present in the commit message, the version will not be bumped
- If `bumpversion major` is present in the commit message, the major version will be bumped
- If `bumpversion minor` is present in the commit message, the minor version will be bumped
- If `bumpversion patch` is present in the commit message (or nothing is found), the patch version will be bumped

**NOTE**: The CI workflow will use the __most recent__ match in the commit history to make its decision.
